This project demonstrates a real-time virtual mouse system that can be controlled entirely through hand gestures captured via a webcam. By using computer vision and hand landmark detection, users can move the cursor, perform clicks, and interact with their system without any physical mouse.

🔑 Key Highlights

Control your mouse pointer with the index finger.

Perform left click, right click, and drag using intuitive hand gestures.

Uses OpenCV for video capture and Mediapipe for hand landmark detection.

Integrates with PyAutoGUI to trigger mouse actions on the system.

Real-time processing with smooth tracking for better user experience.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python 3.x

OpenCV

Mediapipe

PyAutoGUI

🚀 Usage

Run the Python script.

The webcam feed will open.

Use your hand gestures to control the cursor:

🖱️ Index finger → Move cursor

👆 Index + thumb → Left click

✌️ Index + middle → Right click

🤏 Pinch gesture → Drag

📌 Applications

Hands-free control for accessibility.

Touchless interfaces (useful in public spaces).

A fun demonstration of human–computer interaction (HCI).
